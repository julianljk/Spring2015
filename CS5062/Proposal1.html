<h1 id="pageheading" class="main">Iron Deficiency Chlorosis Identifier</h1>
<div class="box generalbox center clearfix">
<div class="no-overflow">
<h2>Proposed by Julian Leong</h2>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong>&nbsp;Iron Deficiency Chlorosis is caused by the
inability of plants to absorb iron from the soil, which causes a reduction in
chlorophyll production that in turn reduces yield, and even plant death.
Agronomists and farmers alike use a visual rating scale from 1-5 in order to
identify the severity of iron deficiency chlorosis. This is a very tedious,
time consuming, and error prone method. It would take hundreds of man-hours
to assess a plot of crop.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong>&nbsp;To resolve this issue, a high-throughput
image analysis software was developed. This software is able to capture the
percentage of IDC infected area and the corresponding IDC rating through
digital imaging. This framework is based on the notion of analyzing the color
maps on the image, as well as utilizing the Naive Bayes Classification method
in order to find a correlation between the percentages of IDC (from imaging)
and the IDC score, allowing for an automated classification of IDC score. To
enhance user experience and data acquisition, an Android application is
proposed to be developed, as users will be able to take pictures with their
phones and obtain the IDC rating instantly.</p>

<p><strong>Essential features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile Android Application</li>
<li>Image pre-processing to remove noise</li>
<li>Image processing to identify a certain range of RGB values</li>
<li>Processing to identify potency of IDC</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Additional features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Move computational work to an external server or cloud to preserve battery life</li>
<li>Development of a database to store previously analyzed pictures along with the metadata associated to it</li>
<li>Robust UI</li>
<li>Precision in processing algorithms</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Potential Issues:</strong>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>As camera sensors differ from phone to phone, there may be calibration issues across phones. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><strong>Platform and development:</strong>&nbsp;The client has created a
basic working version of this softtware in Matlab, the problem lies in
translating it over onto an android platform (which runs on Java). There are
various libraries that exist for Java for image processing such as Marvin,
ImageJ and Open CV. This project would also allow students to learn to use image processing tools
in tandem with the Android platform.</p>
<p><strong>Customer:</strong>&nbsp;Marcus Naik is a student at Iowa State University,
currently pursuing his M.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering. He joined the
Computational Mechanics and Physics lab research group in his junior year of
his undergraduate degree, assisting the Agronomy Department at Iowa State by
investigating the correlation between plant root traits and plant yield using
similar image processing methods. He has also worked on polymer morphology in
the past, investigating how coating different geometries with diblock
copolymers affect the behavior of the polymer, utilizing the supercomputer at
Iowa State (CyEnce) to perform simulations.</p>
<p><strong>Required Skillset:</strong>&nbsp;As the client has specified the
application to be on an Android platform, developers experienced in Android
development would be essential. Aside from that, proficient knowledge in
image processing is essential for the pre-processing and processing of the
photos. </p>
<p><strong>Work Justification:</strong>&nbsp; Image processing is not a very
common area of expertise, thus, it may take some time to get things right in
regard to image processing. Aside from that, moving the processing from the
phone itself to an external processor is a large undertaking on its own. Same
goes with developing a database to store the necessary data. </p>
